In order for the project to run correctly, you need:

1. Install Expo: `npm install --global expo-cli`    
2. Install Node 18.
3. Download Android Studio or Xcode.
4. Install Java 17.
5. Install GradleW.
6. In the Android folder, you need to enter `./gradlew` into the command line. If the command does not work, you need to install Java on your computer in the development environment in the terminal.
7. For iOS, you need a MacBook. Download CocoaPods: `sudo gem install cocoapods`     
8. In the iOS folder, you need to install pods via `pod install`.
9. After all these manipulations, go to the root folder of the project and start the project via `npx expo start`.
